title: "Protein language model powers accurate and fast sequence search for remote homology"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/PLMSearch
excerpt: 'Homologous protein search is one of the most commonly used methods for protein annotation and analysis. Compared to structure search, detecting distant evolutionary relationships from sequences alone remains challenging. Here we propose PLMSearch (Protein Language Model), a homologous protein search method with only sequences as input. With deep representations from a pre-trained protein language model to predict similarity, PLMSearch can capture the remote homology information hidden behind the sequences.'
