Biography
======
* Welcome to my homepage! I am a M.S. student in Applied Mathematics, [ISTBI](https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), where I am advised by Prof. [Shanfeng Zhu](https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/info/1157/2128.htm). Previously, I got my B.Eng. degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). I also had a great time interning at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/).
* My research interests lie in protein language model and its applications in homologous protein search and protein function prediction.
* Please see my [CV](https://maovshao.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for more details.
