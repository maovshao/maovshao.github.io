Biography
======
* Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/), [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I got my M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics from [ISTBI](https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) with Prof. [Shanfeng Zhu](https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/info/1157/2128.htm). Previously, I got my B.Eng. degree in Automation from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). I also have a great time interning at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and [Biomap](https://www.biomap.com/).
* My research interests lie in **Protein Language Model** and its applications in areas like **Homologous Protein Search**. I firmly believe that protein language models will reshape numerous fields in bioinformatics, and I am enthusiastically dedicating my efforts towards it.

* See my [CV](https://maovshao.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for more of what we can do with protein language models.
