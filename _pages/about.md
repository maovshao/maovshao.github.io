I am a M.S. student in Applied Mathematics at Fudan University, advised by [Shanfeng Zhu](https://istbi.fudan.edu.cn/lnen/info/1157/2128.htm). Know more about me at [CV](https://maovshao.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Research Interests
======
* **Protein Language Model**. Design unique multi-task modules for pre-training to improve the performance of protein language models in downstream applications.
* **Homologous Protein Search**. By predicting the similarity with protein embeddings (generated by protein language model), the homologous protein search tool can achieve a SOAT sensitivity while being versatile and fast because it is only based on sequences.
* **Protein Function Prediction**. Utilize multiple protein properties to predict Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.
